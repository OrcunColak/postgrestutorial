-- Unused indexes may lead to a higher number of operations. Database needs to update the table and also to update all the indexes.
-- You can see how indexes are used with the following query:

SELECT
    idstat.relname AS table_name,
    indexrelname AS index_name,
    idstat.idx_scan AS index_scans_count,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) AS index_size,
    tabstat.idx_scan AS table_reads_index_count,
    tabstat.seq_scan AS table_reads_seq_count,
    tabstat.seq_scan + tabstat.idx_scan AS table_reads_count,
    n_tup_upd + n_tup_ins + n_tup_del AS table_writes_count,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(idstat.relid)) AS table_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes AS idstat
JOIN pg_indexes ON idstat.indexrelname = pg_indexes.indexname AND idstat.schemaname = pg_indexes.schemaname
JOIN pg_stat_user_tables AS tabstat ON idstat.relid = tabstat.relid
WHERE indexdef !~* 'unique'
ORDER BY idstat.idx_scan DESC, pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC

--You may need to clear history of index usage to get meaningful results in case an index was used before but isnâ€™t anymore. You can do that with the following query:

SELECT pg_stat_reset()
